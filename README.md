# 4501_final_project
- Project Discription:
This project aims to analyze the past trends of taxi and Uber trips. The data used in this project is the hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2009 through June 2015 (https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). The two datasets are cleaned and normalized by removing invalid data. Missing data in distance is filled up using the coordinates, and trips with pickup or dropoff outside the intended region are also removed. After processing, the data is stored in the SQL database and the query commands are implemented for later data retrieval. Several visualizations based on the data are in the last part of the project to reveal interesting trends, including the most popular hour for taking taxi.
